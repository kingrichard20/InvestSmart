# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Distractions and Proper Device Use
* Personal use of electronic devices during meetings is prohibited. Team members should put their phones in their backpacks.

Decision-making
* Consensus is ideal. If there is no clear majority, team members should aim to compromise.

Attendance
* Team members should aim to have no more than 2 unexcused absenses. Legitimate reasons for missing out-of-class meetings include medical issues or those outside a team members control. All team members should aim to show up for in-class meetings no later than 5 minutes after class begins. To make up for missed meetings, team members with insufficient justification may be given extra work, and the SCRUM master will log the incident.

Assignments
* Assignments may be assigned by the SCRUM master or self-assigned with the SCRUM masters consent. Assignments are on the GitHub Project. During meetings, team members are to move completed work into the "In Review" section for review. A poorly-completed assignment may require revision by a different team member. Consistent underperformers may be assigned different tasks in the future, or reported to the professor.

Participation
* We have a Google Doc and group chat to communicate and share info The SCRUM master will ensure every team member has at least one card ready or in progress at the beginning of each meeting. The SCRUM master may assign tasks based on interest and ability. Two team members with the same interest may be assigned to work on a task as a group.

Meeting Times
* Outside class, team members may organize meetings at will. One meeting out of class per week is recommended.

Promptness
* Instances of lateness are to be evaluated individually. Consistent lateness may be reported to the professor.

Conversational Courtesies
* To enforce active listening, team members may be asked to elaborate on proposed ideas. The SCRUM master may have to cut off team members who speak too long or get off-topic. All team members are to respect each others ideas, even if they disagree.

Enforcement and Feedback
* The SCRUM master is responsible for enforcing rules and plays a strong role in directing work. Any team member may provide respectful and constructive criticism to another for violating this Code of Conduct. Any team member may give feedback to another.

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at nathanfeinberg@uri.edu. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
