**Quiz Button or Pop Up**  
**User Story 9: Metrics Collection for Task Success**  
**Metric**: Average completion of quizes and their scores.  
**Problem**: Users are not completing the quizes at the end of the lessons. Possibly unaware and not seeing the button for it.  
**Experiment**: Split the users randomly 50/50 to see which option works best to increase engagement.  
**Variations**: Change the button located at the bottom of the screen to a pop up that appears after a user completes a lesson to ensure the user sees the quiz.
