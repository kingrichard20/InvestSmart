**Quiz Button or Pop Up**  
**User Story 9: Metrics Collection for Task Success**  
**Metric**: Average completion of quizes and their scores.  
**Problem**: Users are not completing the quizes at the end of the lessons. Possibly unaware and not seeing the button for it.  
**Experiment**: Split the users randomly 50/50 to see which option works best to increase engagement.  
**Variations**: Change the button located at the bottom of the screen to a pop up that appears after a user completes a lesson to ensure the user sees the quiz.  

**Investments or Lessons**  
**User Story 2 (User Log In)**  
**Metric**: NPS / Lessons completion rate  
**Problems**: Should we send users to the lesson page when they first sign in, or directly to the "trading" screen  
**Experiments**: Create 2 groups, have 1 go directly to the "trading" screen and the other go to the lessons screen  
**Variations**: Either take the user to the lessons tab after login or the trading tab after sign in. IE, should the user be assumed to know how to trade, or should we have to teach them the basics first.
